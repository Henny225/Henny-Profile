Hi 👋🏾👩🏾‍💻,

My name is Henny. I am a computer science student proficient in Python, Java, C, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Every day, I get to create awesome experiences and engage with a vibrant data community.

🔭 I’m currently focused on building my computer science and cloud engineering skills, while also expanding my knowledge in Java, C, AWS, and Figma.

I am fluent in French and Italian, and I aspire to become fluent in computer languages as well.

🌱 I’m curious about everything and always eager to learn more.

💬 Feel free to share tips on anything related to computer science, AWS, books, or blaxploitation movies.
